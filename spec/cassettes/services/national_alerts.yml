Irma is forecast to move northeast of the local islands, but\nthrough the local outer Atlantic waters Wednesday afternoon through\nearly Thursday Morning. Irma is expected cause dangerous winds, storm\nsurge, rip currents and rainfall impacts across the local islands.\nHurricane force wind gusts are possible across the Northern U.S. Virgin\nIslands, Culebra, Vieques and Northeast Puerto Rico with strong\ntropical force winds likely. The rest of the area is likely to\nexperience tropical storm force winds. Wind gusts with hurricane force\nwind are likely at higher elevations. Rainfall accumulations between 4\nto 8 inches with isolated amounts over 12 are likely Wednesday through\nFriday.\n\nPOTENTIAL IMPACTS\n-----------------\n\n* WIND:\nProtect against life-threatening wind having possible catastrophic\nimpacts across the across the northern U.S. Virgin Islands, Culebra and\nthe northeast quadrant of Puerto Rico. Potential impacts in this area\ninclude:\n- Structural damage to sturdy buildings, some with complete roof\nand wall failures. Complete destruction of mobile homes. Damage\ngreatly accentuated by large airborne projectiles. Locations\nmay be uninhabitable for weeks or months.\n- Numerous large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and\nroadway signs blown over.\n- Many roads impassable from large debris, and more within urban\nor heavily wooded places. Many bridges, causeways, and access\nroutes impassable.\n- Widespread power and communications outages.\n\nAlso, protect against life-threatening wind having possible extensive\nimpacts across all islands.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN:\nProtect against life-threatening rainfall flooding having possible\nextensive impacts across all the islands. Potential impacts include:\n- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and rescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in\nmultiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, arroyos, and\nditches may become dangerous rivers. In mountain areas,\ndestructive runoff may run quickly down valleys while\nincreasing susceptibility to rockslides and mudslides. Flood\ncontrol systems and barriers may become stressed.\n- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple\ncommunities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed\naway. Many places where flood waters may cover escape routes.\nStreets and parking lots become rivers of moving water with\nunderpasses submerged. Driving conditions become dangerous.\nMany road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out.\n\nProtect against dangerous rainfall flooding having possible\nsignificant impacts across all impacts.\n\n* SURGE:\nProtect against life-threatening surge having possible devastating\nimpacts across all islands. Potential impacts in this area include:\n- Widespread deep inundation, with storm surge flooding greatly\naccentuated by powerful battering waves. Structural damage to\nbuildings, with many washing away. Damage greatly compounded\nfrom considerable floating debris. Locations may be\nuninhabitable for an extended period.\n- Near-shore escape routes and secondary roads washed out or\nseverely flooded. Flood control systems and barriers may become\nstressed.\n- Extreme beach erosion. New shoreline cuts possible.\n- Massive damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers.\nNumerous small craft broken away from moorings with many lifted\nonshore and stranded.\n\nAlso, protect against life-threatening surge having possible\nsignificant to extensive impacts across all the islands.\n\nAlso, protect against locally hazardous surge having possible limited\nimpacts across .\n\n* TORNADOES:\nProtect against a tornado event having possible limited impacts\nacross PUERTO RICO AND THE US VIRGIN ISLANDS. Potential impacts\ninclude:\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution\nof emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power\nand communications disruptions.\n- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys\ntoppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned,\nlarge tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees\nknocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats\npulled from moorings.",

Winds are expected\nto peak in these areas around midnight before diminishing\nWednesday morning. Strong and gusty winds across the Matanuska\nValley will develop by late this afternoon and should peak\novernight.\n\nModerate to locally heavy rainfall will also accompany this\nsystem with the brunt of the rain along the North Gulf Coast and\nsouthern and eastern Kenai Peninsula through tonight. This will be\na fast moving system which should limit the duration of heavier\nrainfall, so there are no flooding concerns at this time.\n\nIn Seward specifically, rain and winds will work in tandem to\ncause potential impacts. 2 to 3 inches of rainfall are expected in\nabout an 18 hour period from this afternoon through Wednesday\nmorning. South winds will develop tonight ranging from 15 to 30\nmph with gusts as high as 45 mph.

Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or significant loss of\nlife. If flood related watches and warnings are issued,\nheed recommended actions. Poor decisions may result in\nbeing cut off or needlessly risk lives. If vulnerable,\nrelocate to safe shelter on higher ground before flood\nwaters arrive.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and\nrescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in\nmultiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, arroyos,\nand ditches may become dangerous rivers. In mountain areas,\ndestructive runoff may run quickly down valleys while\nincreasing susceptibility to rockslides and mudslides.\nFlood control systems and barriers may become stressed.\n- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple\ncommunities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or\nwashed away.

Remaining efforts to secure\nproperties should now be brought to completion.\n- Dangerous and life-threatening wind is possible. Failure to\nadequately shelter may result in serious injury or loss of\nlife. Move to safe shelter before the wind becomes\nhazardous.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Considerable roof damage to sturdy buildings, with some\nhaving window, door, and garage door failures leading to\nstructural damage. Mobile homes severely damaged, with some\ndestroyed. Damage accentuated by airborne projectiles.\nLocations may be uninhabitable for weeks.\n- Many large trees snapped or uprooted along with fences and\nroadway signs blown over.\n- Some roads impassable from large debris, and more within\nurban or heavily wooded places. Several bridges, causeways,\nand access routes impassable.\n- Large areas with power and communications outages.\n\n* STORM SURGE\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST: Localized storm surge possible\n- Peak Storm Surge Inundation: The potential for 1-3 feet\nabove ground somewhere within surge prone areas\n- Window of concern: Wednesday morning until Thursday morning\n\n- CURRENT THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Elevated\n- The storm surge threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- Emergency plans should include a reasonable threat for peak\nstorm surge flooding of greater than 1 foot above ground.\n- To be safe, prepare for the potential of limited storm\nsurge flooding impacts. Efforts should now be brought to\ncompletion before conditions deteriorate.\n- Localized inundation is possible. Follow the instructions\nof local officials. Consider voluntary evacuation if\nrecommended. Leave immediately if evacuation orders are\nissued.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- Localized inundation with storm surge flooding mainly along\nimmediate shorelines and in low-lying spots, or in areas\nfarther inland near where higher surge waters move ashore.\n- Sections of near-shore roads and parking lots become\noverspread with surge water. Driving conditions dangerous\nin places where surge water covers the road.\n- Moderate beach erosion. Heavy surf also breaching dunes,\nmainly in usually vulnerable locations. Strong rip currents.\n- Minor to locally moderate damage to marinas, docks,\nboardwalks, and piers. A few small craft broken away from\nmoorings.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 4-8 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- CURRENT THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: High\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- Emergency plans should include a reasonable threat for\nmajor flooding where peak rainfall totals well exceed\namounts conducive for flash flooding and rapid inundation.\nRescues and emergency evacuations are likely.\n- To be safe, aggressively prepare for the potential of\nextensive flooding rain impacts.\n- Life-threatening flooding is possible. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or significant loss of\nlife. If flood related watches and warnings are issued,\nheed recommended actions. Poor decisions may result in\nbeing cut off or needlessly risk lives. If vulnerable,\nrelocate to safe shelter on higher ground before flood\nwaters arrive.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and\nrescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in\nmultiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, arroyos,\nand ditches may become dangerous rivers. In mountain areas,\ndestructive runoff may run quickly down valleys while\nincreasing susceptibility to rockslides and mudslides.\nFlood control systems and barriers may become stressed.\n- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple\ncommunities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or\nwashed away. Many places where flood waters may cover\nescape routes. Streets and parking lots become rivers of\nmoving water with underpasses submerged. Driving conditions\nbecome dangerous. Many road and bridge closures with some\nweakened or washed out.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- CURRENT THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Elevated\n- The tornado threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- When implementing emergency plans, include a reasonable\nthreat for isolated tornadoes.\n- To be safe, prepare for the potential of limited tornado\nimpacts.\n- Listen for tornado watches and warnings. Be ready to\nshelter quickly if a tornado approaches.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited\n- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the\nexecution of emergency plans during tropical events.\n- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with\npower and communications disruptions.\n- Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings,\nchimneys toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or\noverturned, large tree tops and branches snapped off,\nshallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving vehicles blown\noff roads, and small boats pulled from moorings.\n\n* FOR MORE INFORMATION:\n- HTTP://WWW.SRH.NOAA.GOV/SJU/",

Evacuation efforts\nshould now be brought to completion. Evacuations must be\ncomplete before driving conditions become unsafe.\n- Life-threatening inundation is possible. Failure to heed\nevacuation orders may result in serious injury, significant\nloss of life, or human suffering. Leave if evacuation\norders are given for your area. Consider voluntary\nevacuation if recommended. Poor decisions may result in\nbeing cut off or needlessly risk lives.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Large areas of deep inundation with storm surge flooding\naccentuated by battering waves. Structural damage to\nbuildings, with several washing away. Damage compounded by\nfloating debris. Locations may be uninhabitable for an\nextended period.\n- Large sections of near-shore escape routes and secondary\nroads washed out or severely flooded. Flood control systems\nand barriers may become stressed.\n- Severe beach erosion with significant dune loss.\n- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers. Many\nsmall craft broken away from moorings, especially in\nunprotected anchorages with some lifted onshore and\nstranded.\n\n* FLOODING RAIN\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 4-8 inches, with locally\nhigher amounts\n\n- CURRENT THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: High\n- The flooding rain threat has remained nearly steady from\nthe previous assessment.\n- Emergency plans should include a reasonable threat for\nmajor flooding where peak rainfall totals well exceed\namounts conducive for flash flooding and rapid inundation.\nRescues and emergency evacuations are likely.\n- To be safe, aggressively prepare for the potential of\nextensive flooding rain impacts.\n- Life-threatening flooding is possible. Failure to take\naction may result in serious injury or significant loss of\nlife. If flood related watches and warnings are issued,\nheed recommended actions. Poor decisions may result in\nbeing cut off or needlessly risk lives. If vulnerable,\nrelocate to safe shelter on higher ground before flood\nwaters arrive.\n\n- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Extensive\n- Major rainfall flooding may prompt many evacuations and\nrescues.\n- Rivers and tributaries may rapidly overflow their banks in\nmultiple places. Small streams, creeks, canals, arroyos,\nand ditches may become dangerous rivers. In mountain areas,\ndestructive runoff may run quickly down valleys while\nincreasing susceptibility to rockslides and mudslides.\nFlood control systems and barriers may become stressed.\n- Flood waters can enter many structures within multiple\ncommunities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or\nwashed away. Many places where flood waters may cover\nescape routes. Streets and parking lots become rivers of\nmoving water with underpasses submerged. Driving conditions\nbecome dangerous. Many road and bridge closures with some\nweakened or washed out.\n\n* TORNADO\n- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:\n- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes\n\n- CURRENT THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Elevated\n- The tornado threat has remained nearly steady from the\nprevious assessment.\n- When implementing emergency plans, include a reasonable\nthreat for isolated tornadoes.\n- To be safe, prepare for the potential of limited tornado\nimpacts.\n- Listen for tornado watches and warnings.
